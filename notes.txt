We decided to program a navigation that doesn't care about the error. 

We got the travel_to function within 1mm

point to point algorithm works but with a non-trivial error

TO DO:
	Better callibration for distances, etc ---Andres
	build map ---Gabe
	function to map IR readings to real distances given calibration data ---Gabe
	A* algorithm ---Andres
	Particle filter! --- Both
	Raycasting/simulation for expected ---Gabe 
	detect found food function ---Andres

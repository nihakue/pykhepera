We decided to program a navigation that doesn't care about the error. 

We got the travel_to function within 1mm

point to point algorithm works but with a non-trivial error


not used A*. Used a similar algorithm because we already know the value of the distance to the origin from all our map points.
all our map movements will be from a node to home, or from home to a node (that path is the inverse of node-home)
Tested the algorithm with tribial test (function navmap in tests)



TO DO:
	Better callibration for distances, etc ---Andres
	build map ---Gabe
	function to map IR readings to real distances given calibration data ---Gabe
	A* algorithm ---Andres (done, in map.py)
	Particle filter! --- Both
	Raycasting/simulation for expected ---Gabe 
	detect found food function ---Andres
